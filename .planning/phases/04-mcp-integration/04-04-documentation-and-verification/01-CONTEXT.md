# 04-04: Documentation and Verification - Context

## Current State
- Phase 3: Service Layer completed with business logic
- Phase 4: 04-01 created MCP tool handlers (not yet executed)
- Phase 4: 04-02 created session validation middleware (not yet executed)
- Phase 4: 04-03 created tool registration and testing (not yet executed)
- Existing project documentation in README.md

## Dependencies
- Requires all previous Phase 4 plans to be completed
- Depends on comprehensive testing from 04-03
- Must integrate with existing project documentation

## Technical Approach
- Create comprehensive documentation for MCP tool usage
- Update project documentation with MCP integration details
- Create verification report documenting success criteria
- Ensure all requirements are traceable and verified

## Key Considerations
- Documentation should be clear and comprehensive for agent developers
- Verification should confirm all requirements are met
- Test results should be documented
- Should include usage examples and error handling information
- Documentation should cover session validation and security aspects
