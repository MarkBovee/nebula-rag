# Research Prompt: MCP Integration

## Research Focus
Investigate MCP (Model Context Protocol) integration patterns for .NET 10 applications, focusing on:
- MCP tool handler implementation in C#
- Session validation middleware patterns
- Error handling for session ownership violations
- Integration with existing service layers
- Security considerations for agent access

## Key Questions
1. What are the standard patterns for implementing MCP tools in .NET?
2. How to implement session validation middleware for MCP tools?
3. What are best practices for error handling in MCP implementations?
4. How to integrate MCP tools with existing service layers?
5. What security considerations are important for agent access?

## Sources to Research
- MCP specification documentation
- .NET MCP implementation examples
- Session management patterns
- Middleware design patterns
- Error handling best practices

## Deliverables
- Research findings on MCP implementation patterns
- Recommendations for session validation approach
- Security considerations for agent access
- Integration strategy with existing services
