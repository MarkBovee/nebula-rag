# Scope guardrails

## Purpose

Keep intake focused on clarifying the requested feature/project without expanding scope unintentionally.

## Guardrail behavior

- If the user introduces a net-new capability outside the current scope, capture it as deferred.
- Redirect the conversation back to the active gray area.
- Do not merge deferred ideas into accepted scope during intake.

## Redirect pattern

Use this response style:

`That sounds like a separate capability. I will add it to deferred ideas and keep focus on the current scope.`

Then continue with the current area question.

## Deferred item format

Capture each deferred item with:

- `title`
- `reason deferred`
- `suggested future phase`

## Hard stop conditions

Pause and ask for explicit confirmation if:

- The user changes core goal mid-intake
- The user requests contradictory outcomes
- The user asks to combine multiple unrelated features into one intake
