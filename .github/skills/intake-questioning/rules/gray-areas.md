# Gray area rules

Use these rules to create discussion areas that actually influence planning.

## Shared rules

- Generate 3-4 areas per round.
- Areas must be specific, not generic categories.
- Each area should map to one planning decision that changes task breakdown.
- If the user remains vague, prefer areas that force concrete trade-offs.

## Feature mode (`feature`)

Prioritize implementation decisions such as:

- User flow and entry points
- Data model and state boundaries
- Integration points and dependency choices
- Error handling and fallback behavior
- Acceptance criteria and observability

Example area labels:

- `Entry flow`
- `State model`
- `Deps choice`
- `Failure UX`

## Project mode (`project`)

Prioritize bootstrap decisions such as:

- Problem statement and target user
- Core outcome for v1
- Boundaries and non-goals
- Delivery constraints (time, stack, integrations)
- Definition of done

Example area labels:

- `Target user`
- `V1 outcome`
- `Non-goals`
- `Constraints`
