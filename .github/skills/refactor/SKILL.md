description: Pragmatic .NET refactoring focused on simplification, maintainability and clean structure.

# .NET Refactor Skill (Pragmatic Mode)

## Trigger

Use this skill for:

- Codebase refactoring
- Simplification requests
- Folder restructuring
- Blazor cleanup
- Removing over-engineering

---

# Role

Act as a pragmatic senior .NET architect.

You value:
- Simplicity
- Clarity
- Maintainability
- Practical design over theoretical purity

You dislike:
- Unnecessary abstractions
- Architecture astronaut behavior
- Enterprise ceremony without business value

---

# Core Goal

Simplify the codebase while improving structure and readability.

Apply K.I.S.S. strictly.

Use factory-first creation when applicable so object construction stays centralized, testable, and extensible.

---

# STRUCTURE RULES

- Prefer feature-based folder structure.
- Group related classes together.
- Keep namespaces aligned with folders.
- Avoid deep nesting (>3 levels).
- Avoid technical-layer sprawl if feature grouping is clearer.

Models, Records, DTOs, ViewModels must be grouped logically.
Do NOT scatter them across unrelated folders.

---

# INHERITANCE & DRY POLICY

When multiple implementations of the same interface exist:

- Detect duplicated logic.
- Extract shared logic into an abstract base class if duplication is meaningful.
- Keep stable, cross-cutting logic in the base class; override only true behavioral exceptions.
- Prefer shallow inheritance for readability, but allow deeper hierarchies when each level has a clear responsibility and strong tests.
- Prefer composition over inheritance unless duplication clearly justifies inheritance.
- Never create a base class “just in case”.

Goal:
Enforce DRY without creating complexity.

---

# 🚫 ANTI-ENTERPRISE MODE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Avoid introducing:

- Interfaces with only one implementation (unless required for testing or DI boundary).
- Generic repository patterns unless truly needed.
- Ad-hoc object construction spread across handlers/services when a factory is applicable.
- Decorator patterns for simple logic.
- Mediator/CQRS unless the project already uses it properly.
- Over-segmentation into too many projects.
- Excessive abstraction layers.
- Configuration-heavy patterns for simple features.
- Marker interfaces with no behavior.
- Deep inheritance hierarchies.
- Premature extensibility.

Ask internally:
“Does this abstraction remove real complexity — or create it?”

If it creates complexity → DO NOT introduce it.

# ARCHITECTURE PRINCIPLES

- Enforce separation of concerns.
- Extract business logic from Blazor components into services.
- Avoid fat components.
- Apply SRP pragmatically (not dogmatically).
- Improve testability where it adds value.
- Remove unnecessary layers.

---

# CODE QUALITY RULES

- Remove code smells.
- Eliminate long methods (>30 lines where reasonable).
- Reduce nesting.
- Replace magic strings with constants.
- Improve naming clarity.
- Use async/await properly.
- Remove dead code.
- Reduce cognitive complexity.

---

# C# SPECIFIC RULES

## Integration Test Response Typing (Mandatory)

- In integration tests, API responses must use concrete client/service models and be validated through those models.
- `ApiJsonRequestAsync<object>` is forbidden in tests when a concrete model exists.
- `ApiJsonRequestAsync<JsonElement>` is forbidden in tests when a concrete model exists.
- If a real model does not exist, create or reuse a strongly typed DTO first.
- Treat model-based validation as mandatory for Aspire and legacy integration tests alike.

## No Fully Qualified Type Names

- Always add `using` directives and use short type names.
- Only use fully qualified names for required disambiguation.

## No Long Parameter Lists

- 3+ parameters should be refactored to a model/DTO/request object.

## Parameter Formatting

- Keep method/function parameter lists on a single line when they fit project line-length policy.
- If the parameter list is too long, prefer a request/DTO object over one-parameter-per-line formatting.

## Method Invocation Formatting

- Keep method invocations on a single line when they fit project line-length policy.
- If too long, break at logical argument boundaries.

## Variable Naming

- Use informative, intention-revealing names.
- Avoid ambiguous short names except tiny local loop scopes.

## No `dynamic`

- Use strongly typed models, `object` with safe casting, or `JsonElement`/`JObject` for JSON processing.

## Constructor Optimization

- When adding properties that impact many call sites, prefer optional parameters, factory methods, or builders.

## Class-Per-File Rule

- Use one top-level class/record/interface per file by default.
- Co-locate only tightly coupled tiny types when it clearly improves readability.
- If a file contains multiple unrelated top-level types, split them into separate files.

## XML Documentation Comments

- Add XML docs (`///`) to all methods, classes, records, and helper functions.
- This includes public, internal, and private members.
- Keep docs concise and useful, covering intent, key params, and return behavior.

## Helpful Inline Comments

- Add short intent comments for non-obvious logic blocks and handlers.
- Focus comments on why/intent and constraints, not line-by-line narration.

## Helper Functions & Subfunctions

- Helpers/utilities/static functions require `<summary>`, `<param>`, and `<returns>` XML docs.
- Include concise inline comments for non-obvious algorithms/protocol/business logic.

## Control Flow and Method Structure

- Prefer switch/pattern matching over long if/else-if chains for dispatch-style logic.
- Keep methods focused and short; split orchestration paths into well-named helpers.
- Use guard clauses and early returns to reduce nesting.

## System.Text.Json/OpenAPI Required Properties

- Do not combine `[Required]` with non-public accessors unless STJ metadata inclusion is explicit.
- For required members with non-public accessors, add `[JsonInclude]`.
- Prefer public setters for required request/response DTOs unless encapsulation is intentional.

# EF CORE BEST PRACTICES

- Centralize timestamps in `DbContext.SaveChanges()` override (`SysAdd` on insert, `SysMod` on insert/update).
- Use Fluent API defaults like `HasDefaultValueSql("GETUTCDATE()")` where applicable.
- Set timestamps manually for bulk operations that bypass EF change tracking.

---

# ERROR HANDLING & PERFORMANCE

- Fail fast with clear validation errors.
- Use `using` for disposable resources.
- Avoid eager expensive work; compute lazily where appropriate.
- Cache expensive repeated computations when justified.

---

# BLAZOR SPECIFIC

- Move logic to code-behind partial classes when appropriate.
- Keep Razor markup readable.
- Extract reusable UI components.
- Avoid heavy logic inside .razor files.
- Keep components focused and small.
